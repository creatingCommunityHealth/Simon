Our first HSJ article described deaths in UK healthcare workers from Covid-19. This was one of the first papers to describe the link between ethnicity and increased risk of dying from Covid-19. We used media reports of health and social care worker deaths to identify risks, and included 106 cases. 63% of individuals were of BAME / minority ethnic background, and many were born outside the UK. We noted lower rates in those working in (perceived) higher risk environments such as ICU and anaesthesia. 

We published two follow ups to this article. 

Younger female NHS workers may face greater risk of death from coronavirus. Health Services Journal, 5/5/20. Cook T, Kursumovic E, Lennane S, Kearney L, Woodman E. 

We looked at age and sex of those who died, finding an increase in younger female workers.
